# forkify-project\_\_es6-webpack-api

## The final project from @JonasSchmedtman's "The Comlete JavaScript Course"

This focus of this project was to build a small recipe search app. This project was a "code-along" which gave me experience:

    - using configuration files such as webpack, babel, prettier, eslint
    - Planing the projects MVC architecture
    - Making API calls using axios
    - Building Models, Views, and Controllers for different parts of the app
    - Manipulating the DOM, render HTML components with ES6 strings
    - Problem solving, debugging, and testing
    - and some more that I don't completely understand yet but I followed along.

### This project was a lot to take in and I will need to re-work this using another library so that the lesson sticks.
